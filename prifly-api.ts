/**
 * A copy of prifly's extension contract (apps/desktop-host/src/extensions/api.ts
 * in jimmy927/prifly), kept here so this extension type-checks on its own.
 *
 * What an extension is given, and what it gives back — the whole contract.
 *
 * An extension is a folder with a `prifly-extension.json` manifest and a
 * TypeScript or JavaScript module the host imports:
 *
 *     { "id": "vastai", "name": "Vast.ai boxes", "main": "index.ts",
 *       "description": "…", "version": "0.1.0" }
 *
 * Python tools come from a `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` beside it: prifly
 * builds the extension's `.venv` before starting it (`python.ts`).
 *
 * The module exports `activate(api)`, which may return a function the host
 * calls to stop it. It runs inside the host, with the host's rights: enable
 * only extensions you would run yourself.
